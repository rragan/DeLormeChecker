# DeLormeChecker
Bookmarklet to determine DeLorme pages for Northern, Southern and Golden State.

This is the uncompressed (readable) version of the bookmarklet. A tool like this https://mrcoles.com/bookmarklet/ can convert it to a bookmarklet ready to add to your browser. 

The bookmarklet assumes you are on a geocaching.com cache page and extracts the coordinates of the cache to determine which DeLorme page they are on.
